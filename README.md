# Murder Mystery Game

Personal project for boot.dev

# Plan

To build a randomised text-based murder mystery game with customisable settings.

On each playthrough, the game should build a random map with locations, fill them with family members, staff and a murder victim.

Clues to solve the murder should be placed around the maps, but also found through discussion with the cast. A number of red-herrings should also be placed, with counters made available to rule the red-herrings out.

The goal is to identify the murderer, the murder weapon, and their motive.

Scripts should be loaded in through JSON files to allow for easy customisation, and randomisation should mean any cast member is capable of becoming the murderer.
